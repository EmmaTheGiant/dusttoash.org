This website is, <em style="color: var(--secondary-color);">(currently)</em>, basically a styled, human readable repository for programs.<br><br>
I'll add a dynamic list of programs, or something, that you can check back on frequently or whatever. From there you will be able to download and mess with whatever content you want.<br><br>
Soon, once accounts are added, you'll be able to store data from certain programs from this site, on you account at this site, as well as do other things here.<br><br>

<?php heading("Programs") ?>
A lot of the content that I make gets uploaded here. There <em style="color: var(--secondary-color);">might</em> things like a Chat Room, Calculator, and some other random crap. I may also upload some content having to do with code in general, or maybe some tutorials or something (on programming). Some good documentation will be nice.<br><br>

<?php heading("Other Stuff", "OtherStuff"); ?>
I may upload some files (stowed away in some folder) on some random things. I might hide them from being listed out by any accessing crawlers, or even people, if I get around to it.<br><br>
